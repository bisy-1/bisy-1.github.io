Hi, I‚Äôm **Ahmed El-bisy**

I‚Äôm a **bug hunter** with a strong interest in exploring web, mobile, and network security. My journey started with curiosity about how systems break, and now I actively research and practice penetration testing to strengthen my skills.

**What I do:**

- Perform web application penetration testing and bug bounty hunting.
- Writeups on vulnerabilities, capture-the-flag (CTF) challenges, and labs.
- Build security tools and create lists for researchers.

**Current Focus:**

- Deep-diving into **web asset security**.
- Expanding knowledge into **mobile** and **network security**.
- Building a **Python-based helper tools**.

**Why I share my work:**  
I believe in learning by teaching. Writing about bugs, labs, and tools not only helps me document my process but also contributes back to the security community.
